# Pancreatic-Cancer-Detection-using-different-classifiers
This prediction is based on the Cancer Antigens data to predict pancreatic cancer
the data set contains Cancer antigens 19-9 and cancer antigens 125 which help us to predict whether a person have pancreatic cancer or not
this cancer antigens help to immune the cancer particles in the body so it is helpful for the detection.
and this project has differnt ML classifiers to get the best accuracy model for the prediction.
